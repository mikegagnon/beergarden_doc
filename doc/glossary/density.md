The *density* of DoS attacks
----------------------------

Density is a characertistic of resource-consumption attacks:

* **Mass** measures the victim's resource consumption.
* **Volume** measures the number of malicious resource requests
* **Density measures** the amount of victim [resources consumed per malicious request](##densityequivalence).

[High-density attacks](##highdensityattacks) are more threatening than [low-density attacks](##lowdensityattacks).
