Low-density attacks
-------------------

In a low-[density](##density) attack, the attacker consumes a massive amount of victim resources by flooding the victim with a large volume of resource requests.

In a way, low-density attacks are the **opposite** of [high-density attacks](##highdensityattacks).

### Low-density attacks:

* are [conventional]()
* are [less powerful]()
* are [less economical]()
* are [noisy]()
* must [exploit generic vulnerabilities]()
* are [less sophisticated]()
* are [more recyclable]()
