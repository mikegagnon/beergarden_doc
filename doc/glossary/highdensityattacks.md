High-density attacks
--------------------

A high-[density](##density) attack is a DoS attack where each individual request consumes a disproportionate amount of resources.

In a way, high-density attacks are the **opposite** of [low-density attacks](##lowdensityattacks).

### High-density attacks:

* are [unconventional]()
* are [powerful]()
* are [economical]()
* are [stealthy]()
* must [exploit specific vulnerabilities]()
* [require specialized development]()
* are often [sophisticated]()
* are [less recyclable]()

### Well known examples:

* [Algorithmic complexity attacks]()
* [HashDos]()
* [Floating-point infinite loop]()
* [Zip bomb]()
