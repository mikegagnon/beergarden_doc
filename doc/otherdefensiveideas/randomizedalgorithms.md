Randomized algorithms
---------------------

* Let's say you must always use an algorithm that has bad worst-case performance
* Is it easy to intentionally trigger worst-case performance?
* Can you make it hard to intentionally trigger worst-case performance?
* Examples:
    * Shuffle before quicksort
    * Randomize hash seed
