Backup algoritms
----------------

* When overload occurs flip a switch that replaces poor-worst case algorithms with good worst-case algorithms
* What kind of algorithms?
    * Approximate algorithms
    * Algorithms that are less complete
    * Algorithms that have poor average-case performance
    * Algorithms that exhibit worst-case performance under different conditions
