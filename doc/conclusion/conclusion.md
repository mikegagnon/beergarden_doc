Conclusions
-----------

1. Promising approach
2. Simpler solutions are effective
3. Difficult to develop a single portable solution
4. Application-specific bouncers will be better
5. Reducing thread-pool size during attack will be better
6. JS puzzles won't stop DDoS
    * Instead, use application-specific rate-limiting
    * e.g. rate limit according to username
